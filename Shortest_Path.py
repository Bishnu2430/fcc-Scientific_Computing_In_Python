# Description:
This program finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. It calculates both the shortest distance and the path taken from a given starting node to a target node (or all nodes if no target is specified).

#What It Does:

Graph Representation:
 - The graph is stored as a dictionary where each node has a list of connected nodes along with their respective edge weights.
 - Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm Implementation:
 - Initializes all distances to infinity except for the starting node (set to 0).
 - Iteratively selects the unvisited node with the smallest distance.
 - Updates distances to neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found.
 - Maintains a record of the shortest path sequence for each node.

Output:
 - If a target node is specified, it prints the shortest distance and path to that node.
 - If no target is given, it prints the shortest paths to all nodes.

Example Usage:
Running shortest_path(my_graph, 'A', 'F') gives:

A-F distance: 6  
Path: A -> B -> F  

This program efficiently finds the optimal path in a weighted graph, making it ideal for route planning, network optimization, and problem-solving in graph theory. ðŸš€

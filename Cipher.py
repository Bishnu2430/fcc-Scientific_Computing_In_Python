#Description

The Vigen√®re Cipher is a method of encrypting and decrypting alphabetic text using a simple polyalphabetic substitution technique. It employs a repeating key to determine the shift for each character in the text, offering more complexity compared to a simple Caesar Cipher.

#What It Does

1. Encryption:

A plaintext message is combined with a repeating keyword.
Each character in the plaintext is shifted by an amount determined by the corresponding character in the keyword.
Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.

2. Decryption:

The ciphertext is reversed by shifting each character backward using the same repeating keyword.
Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged, maintaining their position in the text.

3. Process Overview:

- Key Alignment: The keyword is repeated to match the length of the message.
- Character Substitution: Each character in the message is substituted using the alphabet's index:
    - Encryption: The index of the plaintext character is incremented by the index of the keyword character (modulo the alphabet size).
    - Decryption: The index of the ciphertext character is decremented by the index of the keyword character (modulo the alphabet size).
- Output: The transformed text (encrypted or decrypted) is returned.

This program efficiently handles encryption and decryption while preserving spaces, punctuation, and case insensitivity, making it both functional and versatile for text-based ciphers.
